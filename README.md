# My* notes for Data Science and Machine Learning

### Jupyter Notebooks

- This repository contains many notebooks for Data Science and Machine Learning.
- The asterisk (*) is put there because most of the jupyter notebooks are part of a very fantastic and mostly free course by [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z). A lot of these notebooks are solutions to tasks given in the course. Others are for explanation and practical demonstration of concepts. And, many of the notebooks are my own creations.
- I use these as reference for my own learning and practice.

I also have proper notes for DS and ML. I have referenced these notebooks in my notes. You can find the notes here:

NOTE: 
- These notes too are mostly based on the course by CampusX.
- But, they also contain other topics and my explnations, analogies, examples, etc. of the existing topics.
- I have linked the appropriate jupyter notebooks in my notes.
- You'll also find links to external supplementary materials in my notes.

### Handwritten Notes

1. MIT 6.036 - Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2020, Tamara Broderick):
- Contains my handwritten notes along with lecture slides.


2. MIT RES.6-012 Introduction to Probability, Spring 2018:
- Contains my exhaustive handwritten notes for most parts of the course.
