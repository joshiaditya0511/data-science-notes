# My\* Notes for Data Science and Machine Learning

\*The asterisk indicates that many materials are based on external resources, primarily the excellent and mostly free course by [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z).

## üìå Quick Links to My Notes

I have compiled comprehensive notes for Data Science and Machine Learning, which include both handwritten and digital content. These notes reference the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository and offer additional explanations, analogies, examples, and links to supplementary materials.

> **Note**:
> - These notes are a work in progress. I am still learning Machine Learning and will be adding to them as I go.
> - They are primarily based on the CampusX course but also include additional topics, personal explanations, analogies, and examples.
> - The notes contain links to the relevant Jupyter Notebooks in this repository and external supplementary materials.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following main folders:

### 1. Jupyter Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks covering various topics in Data Science and Machine Learning. These notebooks serve as a reference for learning and practice, and include:

- **Concept Demonstrations**: Notebooks that explain and demonstrate various concepts through practical examples.
- **Original Work**: Notebooks created independently to explore topics beyond the course material.
- **Course Solutions**: Solutions to tasks and exercises from the [CampusX course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z).


### 2. Other Notes

This folder includes additional resources, including my own handwritten notes derived from the following courses:

#### üìù Handwritten Notes

- **MIT 6.036 - Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2019, Tamara Broderick)**:
  - Contains my handwritten notes along with lecture slides, providing insights into foundational ML concepts.

- **MIT RES.6-012 Introduction to Probability, Spring 2018**:
  - Includes my exhaustive handwritten notes covering most parts of the course, essential for understanding probability in the context of ML.
